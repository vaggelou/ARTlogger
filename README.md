# ARTlogger
ARTlogger, a data-logger for a Formula Student race car.

This is code for the ARTlogger project, a project that was developed in order to produce a data-logger for racing purpose, during my time in Aristotle Racing Team (ART), the Formula Student team of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

This datalogger was used in the ART16, the 5th race car produced by the team.

The code was developed to run on a Tiva C TM4C1294NCPDT microcontroller, produced by Texas Instruments, using the Code Composer Studio suite.
